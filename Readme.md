# Mobile Flashcards

# Description

This is the third assesment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

The project is based on the specifications from Udacity Nanodegree and uses React Navite and Redux.

The application allows the user to manage Decks (create new ones and give them a name). On these decks the user can then add Cards, which will have a question and an answer. The purpose of the app is to make quizs using these cards and introduce if the answer was correct or incorrect. A success rate is given at the end of the quiz.
